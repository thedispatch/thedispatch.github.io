<HTML><TITLE>The Dispatch</TITLE><BODY><p>Oceangate's YouTube video titled "The Tragic Accident of the Oceangate Submersible" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LcGrLnzYuU) has sparked a heated debate about the engineering decisions that led to the submersible's catastrophic collapse. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LcGrLnzYuU#t=47.83">The video, which has garnered over a million views since its release, provides a detailed analysis of the design flaws that ultimately caused the submersible to implode during its descent to the Titanic's remains in the North Atlantic.</a></p>
<p>The video begins by highlighting the immense pressure that the submersible faced as it descended to the ocean floor. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LcGrLnzYuU#t=47.83">With a descent rate of 55 meters per minute, the submersible would take 70 minutes to reach its destination.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LcGrLnzYuU#t=14.945">During this time, the equivalent of 5.3 atmospheres of pressure would be added to the sub's hull, resulting in a total weight of 366 Earth atmospheres pressing in from all directions.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LcGrLnzYuU#t=38.565">At the bottom of the ocean, 3,800 meters down, the submersible lost contact with the surface.</a> It was later revealed that the submersible had imploded due to a sudden collapse caused by the immense pressure. The video argues that this tragic accident could have been predicted by any composite material engineer, as carbon fiber composites are not known for their compressive strength.</p>
<p>The video delves into the design challenges faced by Oceangate's Titan submersible, which consisted of two titanium end caps and a filament-wound carbon fiber reinforced epoxy hull. While carbon fiber composites are excellent for tension, they are not ideal for compression, which is the primary force exerted on a submarine's hull. This raised concerns about the submersible's ability to withstand the pressure at extreme depths.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons Oceangate chose to use a carbon fiber composite for the hull was to achieve neutral buoyancy. Submarines like the Titan aim to displace water that weighs as much as the vehicle itself, minimizing the energy required to rise or sink in the water. The lightweight nature of carbon fiber composites helped Oceangate achieve this goal, but it also posed significant risks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LcGrLnzYuU#t=180.39">Typically, submarine hulls are made from steel or titanium, with foam outer layers to achieve the desired buoyancy.</a> However, Oceangate decided to skip the foam layer to cut costs. This decision, coupled with the use of a carbon fiber composite hull, raised serious doubts about the submersible's structural integrity.</p>
<p>The video highlights Oceangate's admission that they did not test their vehicle with a regulatory body. This omission is significant because most major marine operators require vessels to be "classed" by an independent group to ensure they meet accepted standards. By forgoing this testing, Oceangate neglected to address operational risks and potential mechanical failures.</p>
<p>Snap buckling, a failure mode unique to composite materials in deep-sea applications, is another concern raised in the video. This failure mode is characterized by delamination of the internal layer of the pressure vessel, leading to catastrophic failure. While there is limited research on this subject, it is clear that cyclical stresses, such as those experienced during repeated dives, can exacerbate this failure mode.</p>
<p>The video criticizes Oceangate for not subjecting the submersible to fatigue testing, despite undergoing multiple dives to extreme depths. Fatigue testing is crucial for identifying potential failure modes and ensuring the structural integrity of a vessel. Oceangate's reliance on a single classification test conducted by a licensed marine surveyor is deemed inadequate by the video's narrator.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the video questions Oceangate's use of an acoustic monitoring system to detect delaminations and voids in the composite hull. The narrator argues that this system is akin to setting up a camera to warn of approaching thunder without addressing the underlying structural issues. The video suggests that Oceangate's use of this system was primarily for marketing purposes, creating a false sense of security for customers.</p>
<p>The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of responsible engineering practices and the need for engineers to prioritize safety in high-impact industries. It criticizes the trend of moving fast and breaking things, citing examples from the aerospace industry, such as SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, where inadequate design safeguards and poor oversight led to catastrophic accidents.</p>
<p>In light of the Oceangate submersible's tragic accident, the video calls for greater accountability and adherence to safety standards in engineering. It urges engineers to tackle the world's most pressing problems while prioritizing the well-being and safety of those affected by their work.</p>
