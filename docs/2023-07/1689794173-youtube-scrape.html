  <p>New Yorkers Urged to Prepare for Smoke from Canadian Wildfires</p>
<p>New York City residents are once again being advised to prepare for smoke from the wildfires that continue to burn in western Canada. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-wildfire-july-18-1.6909596">Air quality health advisories have been issued for the entire state as winds are expected to carry a smoky haze to the northeast this week.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CupQDkGZ4lw#t=19.085">Canada is currently experiencing its worst fire season on record, with about 25 million acres already burned this year.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CupQDkGZ4lw#t=63.363">Firefighters from around the world, including the Silver State Hotshot crew from Montana, have joined hundreds of American and international firefighters in northern Quebec to combat the relentless wildfires.</a> These specially trained and skilled crews are doing their best to secure the edge of the fires and ensure the safety of nearby communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CupQDkGZ4lw#t=77.644">The scale of the wildfires in Canada is staggering, with a total area burned of 10 million hectares, equivalent to almost 25 million acres.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CupQDkGZ4lw#t=19.085">This area is nearly as large as the state of Ohio and larger than most countries on the planet.</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CupQDkGZ4lw#t=19.085">The fires have become too large to extinguish, and the only result is an abundance of smoke.</a> This means that many American cities could be shrouded in smoke for weeks or even months to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-wildfire-july-18-1.6909596">While some areas have received much-needed rain, it is described as a mere drop in an otherwise empty bucket.</a> The mayor of Sugar Mill, a town threatened by the fires, expresses gratitude for the rain but emphasizes the need to adapt to these new weather patterns. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CupQDkGZ4lw#t=235.501">The Canadian government has even called in the military to assist in dealing with the wildfires.</a></p>
<p>As the fire season continues, there is no end in sight for the smoke and destruction caused by the Canadian wildfires. Residents are urged to stay informed about air quality indexes and be prepared for the worst. The resilience and determination of firefighters and affected communities are evident as they face this ongoing challenge.</p>
<p>The 2023 wildfire season in British Columbia has become the most destructive on record, surpassing the 2018 season, according to the CBC News. Over 13,900 square kilometers of land have already been burned, with recent fire activity contributing to the record-breaking numbers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CupQDkGZ4lw#t=19.085">The B.C. Wildfire Service (BCWS) has reported that wildfires have burned more than 14,100 square kilometers of land this year, breaking the previous record of just over 13,500 square kilometers set in 2018.</a></p>
<p>The surge in fire activity has led to the Canadian Armed Forces assisting the BCWS with hundreds of fires across the province. As of Monday evening, more than 390 fires were burning in B.C., with over 20 of them considered "wildfires of note" due to their visibility or threat to public safety. One such fire, the Young Creek fire, has grown significantly and cut off highway access for the Central Coast community of Bella Coola. Highway 20 remains closed due to the wildfire.</p>
<p>The province has also seen an increase in fire activity in the southeast. The St. Mary's River wildfire near Cranbrook led to the cancellation of flights at the Canadian Rockies International Airport and the tactical evacuation of nearby First Nation residents. Another fire near West Kelowna resulted in an evacuation alert for 18 properties.</p>
<p>In addition to the wildfires, the province is facing widespread drought conditions, with the fire danger rating ranked as high to extreme across much of the province. Four of the 34 basins monitored by the province are experiencing the most severe level of drought, including Vancouver Island, the Bulkley-Lakes basin, and the Fort Nelson basin.</p>
<p>The impact of the wildfires extends beyond property damage and evacuation orders. A nine-year-old boy tragically died after an asthma attack that his parents believe was exacerbated by wildfire smoke. Special weather statements warning of smoke continue to cover most of eastern B.C.</p>
<p>The CBC News also provides resources for readers, such as information on evacuation alerts and orders, as well as ways to submit news tips or report errors. The article concludes with related stories and footer links to CBC's various services and platforms.</p>
<p>Overall, the CBC News article highlights the severity of the 2023 wildfire season in British Columbia, providing information on the extent of the damage, the response efforts, and the ongoing challenges faced by residents in affected areas.</p>
