Over 13,900 sq. km of land has now burned, amid recent surge in fire activity CBC News  \u00b7 Posted: Jul 18, 2023 9:49 AM EDT | Last Updated: July 19 See smoke from a wildfire near Cranbrook, B.C. 1 day ago Duration 0:34 The St. Mary's River wildfire burning near Cranbrook has grown to around 300 hectares, British Columbia's wildfire service says. The 2023 wildfire season in British Columbia has officially surpassed the 2018 season as the most destructive ever recorded\u00a0according to\u00a0area burned. Statistics from the B.C. Wildfire Service (BCWS) show wildfires have burned more than 14,100\u00a0square kilometres of land this year,\u00a0breaking the record of just over 13,500 square kilometres set in 2018. The record fell after a weekend that showed a large uptick in fire activity, with the Canadian Armed Forces now assisting the BCWS with hundreds of fires across the province. More than 390 fires were burning in B.C. as of 10 p.m. PT Monday, most of them in central and northeastern parts of the province. Just over 20 of those are considered \"wildfires of note,\"\u00a0which means they are particularly visible or pose a threat to public safety. They include the \"aggressive\" Young Creek fire that exploded in size over the weekend and cut off highway access for the Central Coast community of Bella Coola. Highway 20 remains closed due to the wildfire, according to DriveBC at 10 p.m. PT Monday. 'Like a nuclear bomb went off': B.C. musician raced to beat Hwy 20 closure as wildfire closed in Military begins deployment, highway to Bella Coola closed as hundreds of wildfires burn across B.C. More than 70 emergency alerts and orders were in place\u00a0across the province on Monday. An evacuation alert means residents should prepare to evacuate their homes, possibly with little to no notice. An evacuation order means a resident should leave immediately. The southeast has also seen an uptick in fire activity. The\u00a0Canadian Rockies International Airport north of Cranbrook cancelled flights on Monday due to the\u00a0St. Mary's River wildfire, which led to the tactical evacuation of residents in a nearby First Nation. On Monday, the B.C. Wildfire Service said a blaze 15 kilometres north of West Kelowna, B.C. was highly visible to\u00a0residents in the area, and it also resulted in an evacuation alert for 18 properties later that night. On Monday, the B.C. Coroners Service issued a public safety bulletin after a nine-year-old boy died after an asthma attack that his parents say was made worse by wildfire smoke. Special weather statements warning of\u00a0smoke continue to cover most of eastern B.C. Cranbrook, B.C., airport reopens after cancelling flights due to nearby wildfire Boy, 9, died of asthma attack made worse by wildfire smoke, parents say B.C.'s drought bulletin also continues to show widespread drought conditions, with the fire danger rating ranked at high to extreme across much of the province. Four of the 34 basins the province monitors are ranked at the most severe level of drought. That includes all of Vancouver Island, the Bulkley-Lakes basin and the Fort Nelson basin.
